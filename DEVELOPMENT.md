# Developer Guide

This is the deep-dive companion to [README.md](./README.md) (quick start).
Read this when you're about to write code: it explains *how the pieces fit
together* and gives concrete recipes for extending or debugging the plugin.
Written for both human contributors and future Claude Code instances picking
this repo back up cold. It also carries the **work log (§0)**, the **feature
status (§0.5)** and the **platform blockers (§9)** — the former VIM_STATUS.md
was retired into those sections (its full text is in git history,
commit 122d18e).

## 0. Work log / current state

### 2026-07-07 night — handoff batch closed: all ☐ probes verified, visual-`e` fix

Picked up the evening handoff below; every open item is now resolved.

- ☑ **indentSelection rewrite live-verified** — fresh app restart to load the
  bundle, then smoke suite **16/16 twice** (the previously-racy
  "v j . indent" step passed both times) and stress **59/59**.
- ☑ **`o` on a ToDo creates a sibling** — probed live via sdk-repl: built a
  todo with `:todo`, pressed `o`; both rems report the same `getParentRem()`
  (the daily doc), new bullet is NOT a child of the todo.
- ☑ **`:todo` on a multi-bullet visual selection** — `vv j j` over three
  bullets + `;todo` ⏎ set todo status on exactly the three selected rems
  (checked via `isTodo()` on all daily-doc children; unrelated rows
  untouched). Command exit cleared the trail, mode returned to normal.
- ☑ **Ctrl-W with a real split pane** — opened a second pane live, then
  `C-w h` / `C-w l` / `C-w w` each switched `getFocusedPaneId()` correctly
  (h→left, l→right, w→cycle). *E2e recipe:* the SDK cannot open a split
  (`window.openRem` takes no pane arg); **Shift+click on a rem-reference
  link** opens it in a new pane (Ctrl+click and Alt+click do nothing). Close
  it via the pane-header icon button (hover top of the pane).
- ☑ **Charwise visual rendering** — eyeballed via screenshot: the native
  text selection tracks the vim selection exactly (`0 v l l l` highlights
  "task"), plus cursorline tint + left bar. Side effect noted: RemNote's
  floating **formatting toolbar pops up over any native selection** — vim
  charwise-visual triggers it. Harmless (keys still work) but visually noisy;
  candidate for a mode-scoped CSS hide if it annoys.
- ☑ **BUG FOUND+FIXED while probing: visual-mode `e` could never advance
  past the current word end.** `state.head` is an ON-char index, but
  `wordEnd` measures from an I-beam caret: from head on a word's last char
  it returns head+1, and the `landsOn` −1 adjustment lands right back on
  head — `v e e e …` stayed stuck forever (live-reproduced: selection never
  grew past "task"). Fix in `handleVisual` (engine.ts): when a `landsOn`
  motion makes no progress, rerun it from head+1 (vim's block-cursor "must
  land later" rule — applies only in visual; normal-mode I-beam `e` already
  guarantees progress). New regression test (`v e` then `e` on
  "one two three"); 116/116 unit, fix verified live (`v e` → "task",
  second `e` → "task one").
- ☑ **copyText/writeClipboard decision (was the last ☐): KEEP the sandbox
  tiers, comments fixed.** They're proven dead only on the *desktop* app;
  the try is free, other hosts (web) may grant clipboard-write, and the
  `clip:api`/`clip:exec` badges are exactly how we'd notice. The comments
  now say the select+cut+reinsert fallback is the real live path instead of
  calling the direct write "preferred". §0.5 wording was already aligned.

No engine/adapter contract changes beyond the `handleVisual` fix; harness
untouched.

### 2026-07-07 evening — HANDOFF: live e2e verified, native rem-clipboard landed

Read this first — it supersedes the "BLOCKED" status of the entry below.
Session ended mid-verification (account switch); here is the exact state.

**Live environment (was running at handoff, easy to recreate):**

- e2e RemNote on CDP **9223** via `./e2e/launch.sh` (run in background; app up
  in ~30 s). Login **persists** in the scratch HOME (`/tmp/remnote-vim-e2e-home`,
  `e2e/.env` account, knowledge base "VIM") — it boots straight into the
  Daily Document. Webpack dev server on 8080 (`npm run dev`) serves the
  plugin; RemNote side is already configured to develop-from-localhost.
- **The plugin iframe does NOT pick up rebuilds**: webpack rebuilds, but the
  widget keeps running old code (no live-reload handshake), and CDP
  `Page.reload` on the iframe target reloads it *without* re-activating the
  plugin. **Reloading the MAIN window kills the whole app** (RemNote treats
  main-frame reload as exit — verified twice). The only reliable way to load
  a new bundle: `pkill -f 'remote-debugging-port=9223'; ./e2e/launch.sh`.
- Suite invocations that pass:
  `REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9223 VIM_E2E_SETTLE=1600 npm run e2e` and
  `REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9223 VIM_E2E_SETTLE=1600 node e2e/stress.mjs`.
  The raised `VIM_E2E_SETTLE` matters: with the default 900 ms the *first*
  insert after plugin activation still races the key-release and drops the
  first typed char (reproduced: 12/16; with 1600 ms: 16/16).

**⚠ ONE ITEM IN FLIGHT — finish this first:** `indentSelection` in
`src/adapter/adapter.ts` was rewritten this session (derive the indent
destination once per same-parent run instead of re-querying
`positionAmongstSiblings` between `setParent` calls — the re-query races
RemNote's data layer and can return the unit itself as its own "previous
sibling", silently skipping it; reproduced twice as `run.mjs` "v j . indent"
failing on the *pasted-then-indented* beta bullet while stress phase 4
passes). The rewrite is `tsc`-clean and 115/115 on unit tests but **has NOT
been live-verified**. Next action: restart the e2e app (see above) so the
plugin loads the current bundle, then run the smoke suite twice — expect
16/16 both times. If beta still ends up at doc level, instrument
`indentSelection` via `e2e/sdk-repl.mjs` (below).

**Landed this session — whole-rem ops now hit the OS clipboard natively:**

`dd`, `yy`, visual-line `d`/`y` previously wrote the clipboard via
`writeClipboard()` from the sandbox — which **can never work** (see
discoveries). They now go through `nativeClipboardRems()` (adapter):
`editor.selectRem(ids)` → `editor.copy()` → pane-refocus caret recovery,
with `cutRems()` = that + the proven `removeRems()` loop for the delete
family. All verified live: `yy` → `- line` on the OS clipboard
(`clip:native` badge), `v j y` → both bullets, `dd`+`p` round-trip intact,
and typing works immediately after a yank (caret survives). Unit tests
needed no changes (harness semantics already said "clipboard gets the
text" — now it's actually true live).

**Discoveries this session (all probed live on RemNote 1.26.30, §9 updated):**

1. **Sandbox clipboard writes are dead, always**: in the plugin iframe
   `navigator.clipboard.writeText` rejects (`Document is not focused`), the
   `clipboard-write` permission is hard-**denied**, and `execCommand('copy')`
   returns false (no transient user activation ever reaches the iframe —
   stolen keys arrive via async postMessage). `writeClipboard()`'s first two
   tiers are dead weight live; only host-side native paths work. The
   charwise `copyText` action still tries `writeClipboard` first — harmless
   (its select+cut+reinsert fallback does the real work) but a candidate for
   simplification.
2. **`editor.copy()` on a Rem selection works** and writes RemNote's own
   serialization (text/plain `- bullet` lines + rich text/html) — this is
   the only multi-rem clipboard path available to the sandbox.
3. **`editor.cut()` on a Rem selection writes EMPTY html** to the clipboard
   (it serializes *after* removal, apparently). Never use it for rem cuts;
   copy-then-remove instead. (Text-range `cut()` via `selectText` is fine —
   the charwise paths keep using it.)
4. **The `selectRem` "one-way door" has an escape hatch**:
   `window.getFocusedPaneId()` before + `window.setFocusedPaneId(paneId)`
   after clears the Rem selection and restores the text caret to its exact
   pre-selection rem AND column (probed with a marker insert). Everything
   else fails: `collapseSelection`, `moveCaret(Vertical)`, `selectText`,
   `selectRem([])`, `insertPlainText` over the selection, even a real
   Escape (we steal it) — only pane refocus (or a real ArrowDown/click, which
   the plugin can't synthesize) recovers. §9 rewritten accordingly.
5. **RemNote can boot with `pointer-events-none` stuck on
   `.rn-editor-container`** (its suppress-mouse-while-typing state; a real
   pointer never entering the window leaves it set). Symptom: every CDP
   `mouse.click` falls through to `<html>`, `elementFromPoint` returns the
   root, clicks focus nothing — looks exactly like a zoom/coordinate bug
   (it isn't; dpr=1). Both suites now strip the class once at startup;
   `sdk-repl.mjs`/manual sessions may need
   `document.querySelector('.rn-editor-container').classList.remove('pointer-events-none')`.

**New tool — `e2e/sdk-repl.mjs`**: run arbitrary async JS *inside the
sandboxed plugin iframe* with `a` = the live `VimAdapter` and `p` = the
`RNPlugin` (SDK): `node e2e/sdk-repl.mjs 'return await
p.focus.getFocusedRem()'`. Works because the adapter now exposes
`globalThis.__vimAdapter` (constructor; sandbox-scope only). This is how all
of the above was probed — vastly faster than rebuild-and-keypress loops.
Documented in §7.

**Files touched this session** (committed together with this log):
`src/adapter/adapter.ts` (nativeClipboardRems, cutRems, deleteRem/yankRem/
deleteRemSelection/yankRemSelection rewires, yankRemSelection now
invalidates the model, `__vimAdapter` hook, indentSelection rewrite),
`e2e/run.mjs` + `e2e/stress.mjs` (pointer-events strip; stress phase 5
updated to the new v-cycle: `vv`/`vvd` where it meant visual-line),
`e2e/launch.sh` (extracted-AppRun path + APPDIR export, deep-link warning),
`e2e/sdk-repl.mjs` (new).

**Still ☐ after the indent verification** (from the batch below):

- ☐ `o` on a ToDo bullet — verify live it creates a *sibling* (build one
  with `:todo`, press `o`, check `getParentRem()` via sdk-repl).
- ☐ `:todo` on a multi-bullet visual selection — verify live.
- ☐ `Ctrl-W h/l` with a real split pane — verify live.
- ☐ Charwise visual (`v` + `h/l/e` …) selection rendering — eyeball via
  screenshot that the native text selection tracks.
- ☐ Consider simplifying `copyText`/`writeClipboard` given discovery #1
  (drop the dead tiers, or keep as defensive fallback — decide, then align
  the §0.5 wording).

### 2026-07-07 — user-reported bug batch (in progress, Claude)

**Context discovered first:** `dist/` was built 2026-07-06 20:16 but
`src/engine`+`src/adapter` were edited 2026-07-07 ~14:00 — the running plugin
was an OLD build missing today's engine (v-cycle flip, sibling-only `o`,
subtree registers, clipboard). Several user reports were symptoms of the
stale build. Also: the repo had an empty `.git`; a baseline commit of the
pre-fix state is now in history (`main`).

Plan (☑ done / ☐ pending), driven by the user's report:

- ☑ git init + baseline commit; `.gitignore` for node_modules/dist/zip
- ☑ **Ctrl-W h/l panes** — root cause: `ctrl+w` was never in `keymap.ts`, so
  the engine's pane code was unreachable. Added.
- ☑ **v = charwise first** — engine already flipped (v → charwise, `vv` →
  line, `vvv` → normal; j/k still auto-upgrade charwise→line). Unit tests
  updated to the new cycle (they still asserted the old one and failed).
- ☑ **`de` on "a asdf" deleting too much** — `wordEnd` used vim's
  block-cursor rule (`e` must advance ≥2); switched to I-beam rule
  (`e > c`) matching this plugin's between-chars caret model.
- ☑ **`d$`** — already existed as `dgl`/`dgh` g-chords; now unit-tested and
  documented ( `$` itself is unreachable: shift-blind stealing reports `4`).
- ☑ **`;` find-repeat removed** — `;` now always opens the command line;
  `,` keeps reverse-repeat. `/` also opens the command line.
- ☑ **Ctrl-E/Ctrl-Y unbound** — no view-scroll API exists (only caret moves),
  so per user's call the keys are no longer stolen.
- ☑ **Ctrl-O/Ctrl-I jumplist** — new `jump` action; adapter records rem ids
  before jumps (`gg`/`ge`/`:e`) with vim's truncate-forward semantics;
  in-doc return walks the caret (stays alive), cross-doc falls back to
  `window.openRem`.
- ☑ **Yank → system clipboard** — layered: charwise deletes now go through
  native `editor.cut()` (host-side clipboard, sandbox-proof); charwise `y`
  emits new `copyText` action (async clipboard API → execCommand →
  select+cut+reinsert fallback); line register still flattens to
  tab-indented text via `writeClipboard`. Badge shows `clip:` status.
  **Update (evening entry above): verified live — the sandbox tiers can
  never fire; whole-rem ops now use `nativeClipboardRems` instead.**
- ☑ **Normal-mode cursor visibility** — cursorline: `[data-rem-id]
  :focus-within` row tint + colored left bar via registerCSS.
- ☑ **Visual-mode `/` command palette** — `;`/`/`/`:` from visual/visual-line
  enter command mode KEEPING the selection trail (tint stays via render());
  new Ex verbs `:todo`, `:done`, `:untodo` apply to all selected bullets
  (else focused bullet). Command-mode exit always clears the trail.
- ☐ **`o` on ToDo creating a child** — believed fixed by rebuild (old build
  had "child-aware o"; current `newBullet` is sibling-only). Verify live
  against a todo bullet.
- ☑ tests updated + extended (jumplist, clipboard, visual command line,
  charwise g-chords, I-beam `e`): 115/115 green; `tsc` clean
- ☑ live e2e pass — **UNBLOCKED, see the evening entry above**: environment
  works (launch.sh + e2e/.env login persisted), smoke suite 16/16 with
  `VIM_E2E_SETTLE=1600` (then 15/16 ×2 on an indent data race — fix in
  flight, see above), stress 59/59, clipboard tiers verified live. Remaining
  manual probes are re-listed in the evening entry's ☐ section.
- ☑ docs: VIM_STATUS.md was deleted from the working tree mid-session (not
  by Claude — swept into commit daaa04e by `git add -A`; full text
  recoverable from commit 122d18e). Its live content now lives here: feature
  status → §0.5, blockers → §9. `:help` widget (vim_help.tsx) updated with
  the new keys; README links fixed.
- ☑ [SERVICE_NOTES.md](./SERVICE_NOTES.md) — design-only exploration of a
  background companion service (CDP-based) to lift sandbox limits
  (shift-blindness, caret reads, true scrolling, clipboard). Explicitly NOT
  implemented; verdict: park it, file upstream issues first.

Engine/adapter contract changes in this batch (for anyone rebasing):

- `Action.deleteRange` gained `yank?: boolean` (route through native cut →
  OS clipboard) and `keepLead?: boolean` (change-family deletes skip the
  column-0 whitespace swallow AND the model's normalizeModel trim; `cw` must
  leave "hello world" as "bye world", not "byeworld").
- New actions: `copyText {text,start?,end?}`, `jump {dir}`.
- `handleCommand` leave-path now always emits `clearRemSelection`.
- Harness mirrors all of the above + `clipboard`/`jumps` fields for tests.

## 0.5 Feature status (what works live)

Formerly VIM_STATUS.md; trimmed to what a contributor needs. Engine suite:
**115/115** unit tests green (run `npm test` — don't trust this number, verify).

Working live in the real app (RemNote 1.26.30, SDK 0.0.46):

- **Modes** — `i` insert / `Esc` normal / `v` charwise visual / `vv`
  visual-line (`v`+`j/k` auto-upgrades) / `;` `/` `:` command line; mode badge
  bottom-right; per-mode key stealing (insert releases everything but Esc).
- **Motions** — `h l 0 w b e f<c> t<c>` `,`(reverse find repeat), counts;
  g-chords for shift-blind capitals: `gl`=`$` `gh`=`^` `gg` `ge`=`G`.
  `e` uses I-beam semantics (any forward progress counts), so `de` on
  `a asdf` deletes just `a`.
- **Operators** — `d c y` + motions/text objects (`dw de db dd df<c> dt<c>
  diw daw`), `dgl`=`d$`, `dgh`=`d^`, `x X s S D C`, `r<c>`, backtick=`~`.
- **Charwise visual** — `v` + `h/l/w/b/e/f/gl/gh` to shape; `d x c s y p o`;
  `gg/ge/G` escalate to line-wise to the doc boundary.
- **Visual-line (multi-bullet)** — extend with `j/k`/counts/`gg/ge`; `d`/`x`
  cut, `y` yank, `p` paste, `.`/`,` indent/outdent; `;` or `/` opens the
  command line over the selection; registers carry whole subtrees; caret
  walks to a survivor before any deletion.
- **System clipboard** — charwise deletes route through native text-range
  `editor.cut()`; charwise yanks through `copyText` (live path is the
  select+cut+reinsert fallback — direct sandbox writes are permission-denied,
  see §9); whole-rem ops (`dd`/`yy`/visual-line `d`/`y`) through
  `nativeClipboardRems` (`selectRem` + `editor.copy()` + pane-refocus caret
  recovery) — clipboard gets RemNote's own `- bullet` serialization. Badge
  `clip:` field shows which path fired (`clip:native`/`clip:api`/
  `clip:exec`/`clip:FAIL`).
- **Jumplist** — `Ctrl-O`/`Ctrl-I` over `gg`/`ge`/`:e` jumps (vim
  truncate-forward semantics).
- **Panes** — `Ctrl-W` then `h`/`l`/`w`.
- **Scrolling** — `Ctrl-D`/`Ctrl-U` (caret page-moves; view follows).
  `Ctrl-E`/`Ctrl-Y` deliberately unbound — no view-scroll API exists.
- **Command line** — `:help` cheat sheet; `:todo`/`:done`/`:untodo` act on
  the visual selection or focused bullet; `:e <name>` search+open (a jump);
  `:w`/`:q` acknowledged (autosave).
- **New bullets** — `o`/`go`(=`O`) always create a *sibling* (never a child).
- **Cursor visibility** — cursorline row tint + colored left caret bar
  outside insert mode.
- **Undo/redo** — `u`/`Ctrl-R` delegate to RemNote's history.

Known limitations (beyond §9 platform blockers):

- Caret column desyncs after an intra-line mouse click (collapsed caret is
  unreadable in the sandbox); re-anchor with `0`/`gl` or enter+leave insert.
- Charwise visual uses a real native text selection, so RemNote's floating
  formatting toolbar pops up over it (harmless; keys keep working).
- Capitals act as their lowercase key (shift-blind stealing); use synonyms.
- `j`/`k` move between Rems — a bullet is one line by construction.

## 1. Mental model

The whole plugin is built around one idea: **keep the part that has to be
correct (vim semantics) completely separate from the part that has to talk to
RemNote (which is slow, async, and full of platform quirks).**

```
keystroke → adapter (RemNote-facing) → engine (pure) → Action[] → adapter executes them
            src/adapter/adapter.ts     src/engine/       against RemNote's plugin API
```

- **`src/engine/`** is a synchronous, pure function: `(VimState, key, {text,
  caret}) → (VimState, Action[])`. It has never heard of RemNote. It doesn't
  know what a "Rem" is, doesn't await anything, doesn't touch the DOM. This is
  what makes it exhaustively unit-testable and safe to reason about in
  isolation — `tests/engine.test.ts` drives it directly.
- **`src/adapter/adapter.ts`** (`VimAdapter`) is the only thing that touches
  the RemNote plugin SDK. It receives raw stolen keys, translates them to
  engine symbols, feeds them to `handleKey`, and executes the returned
  `Action`s one at a time against the RemNote API (`editor.moveCaret`,
  `rem.createRem`, etc). It also owns a **local model** of the focused line's
  text/caret, because RemNote's own read APIs lag a keystroke behind
  programmatic edits (see §6).
- **`src/widgets/`** is the RemNote plugin entry point (`index.tsx`,
  `onActivate`) plus the `:help` floating-widget UI (`vim_help.tsx`).

If you're adding a new vim *behavior* (a motion, an operator, a new mode
transition), it almost always belongs in `src/engine/`, tested with the
`Harness` fake editor, with zero RemNote involvement. If you're adding a new
way to talk to RemNote (a new `Action` case, a new SDK call), that's
`src/adapter/adapter.ts`. Keep that boundary — it's the whole reason this
codebase is testable.

## 2. Repository map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/engine/types.ts` | `VimState`, `Action` (the full vocabulary of things the adapter can be asked to do), `Mode`, `Pending`, `Register` |
| `src/engine/engine.ts` | `handleKey()` — the state machine. One `handleX` function per mode (`handleNormal`, `handleInsert`, `handleVisual`, `handleVisualLine`, `handleCommand`) |
| `src/engine/motions.ts` | Pure text math: `nextWordStart`, `wordEnd`, `findChar`, `wordObject`, etc. No engine state, just `(string, offset) → offset` |
| `src/adapter/adapter.ts` | `VimAdapter` — key stealing, the local line model, `exec()` (Action → SDK calls), visual-line selection trail, Ex commands, the debug/mode badge |
| `src/adapter/keymap.ts` | Which key specs to steal from RemNote per mode, and the spec→engine-symbol table (`SPEC_TO_SYM`) |
| `src/adapter/domCaret.ts` | Direct DOM caret read/write — only reachable when `requestNative: true` actually works (currently doesn't, see §9) |
| `src/widgets/index.tsx` | Plugin `onActivate`: registers commands/settings, constructs `VimAdapter`, exposes `window.__vim` for e2e |
| `src/widgets/vim_help.tsx` | The `:help` cheat-sheet floating widget |
| `tests/harness.ts` | `Harness` — a fake multi-line/multi-indent "editor" that executes `Action`s the same way the real adapter does, for unit tests |
| `tests/engine.test.ts` | Vitest suite driving `Harness` with key sequences |
| `e2e/run.mjs` | Live smoke test over CDP against a real running RemNote — narrative style, asserts on Rem text |
| `e2e/stress.mjs` | Live stress test — long key sequences with a **focus-alive invariant checked after every keystroke** |
| `e2e/tree.mjs` | Live precision test for nested-hierarchy visual-line selection (tint + data + focus, screenshots archived) |
| `e2e/ctl.mjs` | Manual CDP remote for poking at a running instance (`shot`, `eval`, `click`, `type`, `key`) |
| `e2e/launch.sh` | Launches an isolated RemNote AppImage instance (scratch `$HOME`, its own CDP port) for e2e |
| `public/manifest.json` | RemNote plugin manifest (id, permissions, `requestNative`) |
| `webpack.config.js` | Builds every `src/widgets/**/*.tsx` twice (module + sandboxed-iframe variant); see comments for why |

## 3. Running the plugin locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # webpack-dev-server on http://localhost:8080, no HMR (see below)
```

In the RemNote desktop app: **Settings → Plugins → Build → Develop from
localhost**, enter `http://localhost:8080/`, click **Develop**. Confirm the
"Vim Mode" toggle is on in plugin settings. A `-- NORMAL --` badge should
appear bottom-right — that's your signal the plugin loaded and is active.

There is **no hot reload** (`hot`/`liveReload` are explicitly off in
`webpack.config.js` — RemNote's sandboxed-iframe loading doesn't play well
with webpack's dev-server client). After changing code you must reload the
plugin from RemNote's UI (or reload the whole RemNote window) to pick up new
JS. `npm run dev` just serves the freshly-built files; it doesn't push
updates.

Toggle the plugin on/off at runtime with the command palette action **"Vim:
Toggle vim mode"** (`vim-toggle` in `src/widgets/index.tsx`), and open the
cheat sheet with **"Vim: Help / cheat sheet"** or by typing `;help` inside the
app.

## 4. Reading the debug badge

`VimAdapter.render()` (`src/adapter/adapter.ts:988`) draws two fixed-position
overlays via injected CSS — no devtools needed to see plugin state:

- **Bottom-right** (`body::after`): the mode badge, e.g. `-- NORMAL --`, or
  the live `:command` text while typing an Ex command.
- **Bottom-left** (`body::before`): `vim <mode> rx=<n> done=<n> k=<spec>
  <vTrail debug>` — `rx` is keys received from RemNote's steal event, `done`
  is keys the adapter has fully finished processing (including all resulting
  `exec()` calls). **If `rx !== done` and stays that way, a key handler is
  stuck** — check for an unresolved promise in `exec()`. The e2e scripts poll
  this exact string (`waitIdle()` in `run.mjs`/`stress.mjs`) to know when it's
  safe to read state.

Since it's just CSS `content`, you can read it from a real DevTools console
attached to the page (`getComputedStyle(document.body, '::before').content`)
or via `e2e/ctl.mjs eval '...'` against a CDP-attached instance.

## 5. Working in the engine (`src/engine/`)

### The dispatch shape

`handleKey(state, key, snap)` switches on `state.mode` to one handler per
mode. Each handler returns `{ state, actions }`. Keys are **engine symbols**,
not raw browser events: single characters (`'a'`, `'$'`, `' '`), or named
tokens (`'Escape'`, `'Enter'`, `'Backspace'`, `'C-r'`, `'C-d'`, ...) — see
`src/adapter/keymap.ts` for the full symbol table the adapter produces.

Useful helpers already in `engine.ts` — reuse these instead of hand-rolling:
- `reset(state, actions)` — clear count/op/pending, return unchanged mode
- `toMode(state, mode, actions)` — same, but also switches `mode` and emits
  an `{ t: 'mode', mode }` action (the adapter reacts to mode changes: key
  re-stealing, insert-mode caret sync, etc — always go through `toMode`
  rather than hand-setting `state.mode`)
- `countOf(state)` — combines a pending count with an operator's count
  (`2d3w` → 6)
- `motionFor(state, key, snap, head)` — tries to interpret `key` as a motion
  in the current context; returns `null` if it isn't one. Both `handleNormal`
  and `handleVisual` call this so motions behave consistently across modes.

### Recipe: add a new normal-mode motion

1. Implement the pure text math in `motions.ts` if it's non-trivial (pattern:
   `(text: string, caret: number, ...) => number` or `MotionResult`).
2. Add a `case` to `motionFor()` in `engine.ts` returning `simple(target)` (or
   `{ result: { target, landsOn } }` directly for inclusive motions like `e`
   or `f`). `landsOn: true` means the motion conceptually lands *on* a
   character (used by visual mode to include that character in the
   selection) — see the doc comment on `MotionResult` in `motions.ts`.
3. That's it — because `motionFor` is shared, the new motion automatically
   works standalone (`{key}`), as an operator target (`d{key}`), and inside
   visual mode. Add a unit test in `tests/engine.test.ts` covering all three.

### Recipe: add a new simple normal-mode command (no motion)

Add a `case` to the big `switch (key)` at the bottom of `handleNormal()`
(engine.ts:270+). Look at neighboring cases for the pattern: mutate via
`withCharRegister`/`reset`/`toMode`, return the `Action[]` to emit. If it's a
Rem-structural operation (new register kind, new bullet, indent, etc.), you
likely need a **new `Action` variant** first — see below.

### Recipe: add a new `Action` (new capability the adapter must execute)

1. Add the variant to the `Action` union in `types.ts`, with a doc comment
   explaining semantics — this type is the contract between engine and
   adapter, and both `VimAdapter.exec()` and `Harness.exec()` must implement
   every case (TypeScript's exhaustiveness won't catch a missing `case` in a
   `switch` without a `default`, so grep for `a.t` usages after adding one).
2. Implement the real behavior in `VimAdapter.exec()` (`adapter.ts`).
3. Implement the fake-editor behavior in `Harness.exec()` (`tests/harness.ts`)
   — this is what makes it unit-testable. Keep it a faithful *model*, not
   copy of the real implementation (e.g. `Harness` models Rems as
   `lines`/`indents` arrays, not real tree objects).
4. If the action mutates the document, add its `t` to the `MUTATING` set in
   `harness.ts` so undo/redo snapshots correctly in tests.
5. If the action changes the focused line's text/caret in a way `updateModel`
   in `adapter.ts` needs to track (or invalidates it entirely), add a case
   there too (see §6).

### Recipe: add a new Ex command (`:foo`)

Add a case to the `switch (verb)` in `VimAdapter.runEx()` (adapter.ts:658).
Verbs are matched **case-insensitively** — capitals are unreachable live (see
§9), so `:Ex` arrives as `ex`. No engine changes needed; `runEx` is a leaf
action (`{ t: 'runEx', cmd }`) the engine just passes through verbatim from
`state.commandLine`.

### Multi-key sequences (pending state)

Commands spanning multiple keystrokes (`f<char>`, `r<char>`, `g`-chords,
text objects `di`/`da`) go through `state.pending` (`types.ts`'s `Pending`
union). Pattern: first key sets `pending`, and the top of `handleNormal`
special-cases each `pending.p` value before falling through to counts/motions
/single-key dispatch. If you add a new two-key prefix, add both the "waiting"
branch (top of `handleNormal`) and, if it should work under an operator too,
a case in `handleOperatorKey`.

## 6. Working in the adapter (`src/adapter/adapter.ts`)

### The local model and why it exists

RemNote's `getFocusedEditorText()` lags a keystroke or two behind
programmatic edits. If the adapter re-read RemNote on every key, rapid
sequences (`dwA!`) would compute offsets against stale text. Instead
`VimAdapter` keeps `this.model: { remId, text, caret } | null`:

- `snapshot()` returns the model if present; only calls into RemNote when
  `this.model === null`.
- `updateModel(action)` mutates the model **deterministically** to mirror
  what each `Action` should have done, run right after `exec(action)` for
  every action in the batch — this is the exact same logic `Harness.exec()`
  encodes for tests, just against `this.model` instead of `this.lines[row]`.
- Anything that changes the focused Rem, its structure, or triggers native
  typing must call `this.invalidateModel()` (sets `model = null`) so the next
  `snapshot()` re-syncs from RemNote. The `switch` in `updateModel` is the
  single source of truth for which actions do this — **when you add a new
  `Action`, you must add a case here** (mutate the model, invalidate it, or
  explicitly no-op with a comment, matching one of the three existing
  groups).

If you're chasing a bug where commands compute against the wrong text/caret,
this is the first place to look — either an action forgot to update the model
correctly, or forgot to invalidate it when it should have.

### Why caret moves are relative deltas

RemNote's sandboxed plugin API cannot set an absolute collapsed caret
position (`selectText` with a collapsed range, `collapseSelection`, and
`moveCaret(_, MoveUnit.LINE)` are all no-ops in this sandbox — see §9). The
one primitive that *does* move the real, visible
cursor is `editor.moveCaret(delta, MoveUnit.CHARACTER)` — a relative
character offset from wherever the caret currently is. So every "set caret to
X" in `exec()` (the `setCaret` case, `insertAt`, `setCaretAbs`) computes `to -
from` using `this.model.caret` as `from` (captured **before** the action
runs — `exec` sees the pre-action model, `updateModel` runs after) and issues
a relative move. If you add a new action that needs to position the caret,
follow this exact pattern; don't reach for an absolute-set API — none exists.

### Key stealing and the shift-blindness workaround

`applyMode(mode)` diffs the wanted key set (`bindingsForMode(mode)` in
`keymap.ts`) against `this.stolenSpecs` and calls
`app.stealKeys`/`releaseKeys` incrementally. RemNote's steal matcher cannot
distinguish Shift — see `keymap.ts`'s top comment and §9 for the empirical
writeup. Practical consequence for anyone
adding a keybinding: **you cannot bind a capital letter or a shifted symbol
to a different command than its lowercase key** — RemNote reports both as the
same spec. The existing pattern is unshifted synonyms via `g`-chords (`ge` =
`G`, `gl` = `$`, `gh` = `^`, `go` = `O`) or reused punctuation (`` ` `` = `~`,
`;` = `:`, `.`/`,` = `>`/`<` in visual-line). Follow this pattern for new
capital-only vim commands rather than trying to bind the real key.

### Visual-line selection trail

Visual-line mode doesn't use RemNote's real Rem-selection (`editor.selectRem`
kills the text caret irrecoverably — blocker #4). Instead `vTrail: string[]`
records the sequence of Rem ids the caret has visually walked through
(`vStart`/`vExtend` in `exec()`), `normalizedTrail()` collapses it to
top-level selected units (dropping ids covered by an ancestor already in the
trail), and `expandWithDescendants()` turns that into the full set of ids to
CSS-tint (since RemNote's DOM doesn't nest child rows inside the parent's
container, every row needs its own selector). `tests/harness.ts` mirrors this
exact algorithm using row indices + an `indents` array instead of a real
tree — if you touch the trail logic in the adapter, update
`Harness`'s `vExtend`/`deleteRemSelection`/etc in lockstep or the unit tests
will silently test a different algorithm than production runs.

## 7. Testing

Two independent layers with different jobs. Prefer the unit suite for anything that's pure vim
semantics; reach for e2e only when the bug is specifically about RemNote
integration (caret visibility, focus survival, tree structure).

### Unit tests — `npm test` / `npm run test:watch`

Vitest, `tests/engine.test.ts` against `tests/harness.ts`'s `Harness`. No
RemNote involved — this is the fast, deterministic feedback loop; run it
constantly while working in `src/engine/`.

```ts
const h = new Harness(['hello world'], /* row */ 0, /* caret */ 0);
h.keys('dw');
expect(h.lines[0]).toBe('world');
```

`Harness.keys(seq)` tokenizes a string (`<esc>`, `<cr>`, `<bs>`, `<space>`,
`<c-r>`, `<c-d>`, `<c-u>`, `<c-w>`, `<c-o>`, `<c-i>` for named keys;
everything else char-by-char) and feeds each through `handleKey` exactly like
the adapter does, except insert-mode plain characters are typed directly into
`lines` (mirroring that insert mode releases stolen keys live). Use a 4th
constructor arg (`indents: number[]`) to build a nested-tree fixture for
visual-line tests. `Harness.clipboard` models what the adapter would have
written to the system clipboard; `jumps`/`jumpPos` model the adapter's
jumplist with row numbers standing in for rem ids.

### Live e2e — `e2e/run.mjs`, `e2e/stress.mjs`, `e2e/tree.mjs`

All three connect to a **running RemNote instance** over the Chrome DevTools
Protocol via `playwright-core`'s `connectOverCDP`, find the app page, and
require the dev plugin already loaded and enabled with today's Daily
Document open. They read state through RemNote's own **read-only** data API
(`window.Rem(...).findOne(...)`, `getText()`), never by parsing rendered DOM
text for assertions (DOM is only used to locate bullets to click).

Start an isolated instance first:

```bash
REMNOTE_APPIMAGE=/path/to/RemNote.AppImage ./e2e/launch.sh   # or auto-finds one under ~/Applications
```

This uses a scratch `$HOME` (`/tmp/remnote-vim-e2e-home` by default) so it
won't collide with your real RemNote profile, and defaults its CDP port to
**9223**. Then load+enable the dev plugin in that instance (Settings →
Plugins → Build → Develop from localhost, same as §3) and open today's Daily
Document.

**Port caveat:** `launch.sh`/`ctl.mjs` default to port `9223`;
`run.mjs`/`stress.mjs`/`tree.mjs` default to `9222`. These do **not** agree —
always pass `REMNOTE_CDP_PORT` explicitly to whichever script you run so it
matches the port `launch.sh` actually started on, e.g.:

```bash
REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9223 npm run e2e                 # run.mjs narrative smoke test
REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9223 node e2e/stress.mjs          # long sequences + focus-alive invariant
REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9223 node e2e/tree.mjs            # nested-hierarchy visual-line precision test
```

(README's example instead runs `launch.sh` with defaults and `npm run e2e`
with `REMNOTE_CDP_PORT=9222` explicitly — that only works if something else
is already listening on 9222, e.g. your everyday RemNote launched with
`--remote-debugging-port=9222`. Pick one instance and use its real port
consistently.)

All three scripts scope every DOM query to bullets whose Rem-ancestor chain
reaches the open Daily Document (matched by the URL slug's trailing id), so
they can't touch your other real documents even if other panes are open —
and they clean up after themselves (`resetEmpty()` sweeps the daily note back
to one empty bullet).

- **`run.mjs`** — a single continuous narrative (each command builds on the
  previous result) asserting exact resulting text after each step. Good
  first check after any adapter change.
- **`stress.mjs`** — long, more chaotic sequences with a **focus-alive
  invariant** checked after *every* keystroke (a focused Rem or editable
  element must exist, unless deliberately in visual-line mode). This is what
  originally caught "dead cursor after cut" class bugs — run it after
  touching `removeRems`/`walkCaretOut`/`walkCaretTo` or anything else that
  moves focus across Rems.
- **`tree.mjs`** — precision test for the visual-line trail on a real nested
  tree, checking three channels per step (CSS tint, data/parent links, focus
  alive) and archiving a screenshot per phase to `e2e/shots/`. Run this after
  touching `vTrail`/`normalizedTrail`/`expandWithDescendants`.

### Manual poking — `e2e/ctl.mjs`

A tiny CDP remote for one-off inspection against a running (launch.sh'd)
instance, port defaults to 9223:

```bash
node e2e/ctl.mjs shot out.png                 # screenshot the app
node e2e/ctl.mjs eval 'document.title'        # run arbitrary JS in the page
node e2e/ctl.mjs key 'j j x'                  # press a key sequence (space-separated)
node e2e/ctl.mjs type 'hello'                 # type text
node e2e/ctl.mjs click '.EditorContainer'     # click a selector
```

Handy for reproducing a live bug interactively before writing it into
`stress.mjs`/`tree.mjs` as a regression check, or for reading the debug badge
live (`eval "getComputedStyle(document.body,'::before').content"`).

### SDK REPL — `e2e/sdk-repl.mjs`

Runs an async JS body *inside the sandboxed plugin iframe*, with `a` bound to
the live `VimAdapter` instance and `p` to the `RNPlugin` (the adapter exposes
itself as `globalThis.__vimAdapter` for exactly this):

```bash
node e2e/sdk-repl.mjs 'const f = await p.focus.getFocusedRem(); return f?.text;'
node e2e/sdk-repl.mjs 'return (await p.editor.getSelection())?.type ?? "none";'
```

This is the fastest way to answer "what does SDK call X actually do live?" —
no rebuild, no keypress choreography. All of the §9 selection/clipboard
findings were probed this way. Caveats: the app must be running with the dev
plugin loaded (it attaches to the `localhost:8080` iframe CDP target), and
state you mutate is real — clean up after probes. Remember the app restart
requirement when you edit adapter code (§0 evening entry): the iframe does
not pick up rebuilds; `pkill -f 'remote-debugging-port=9223'` and relaunch.

## 8. Debugging checklist

- **Key does nothing live, but the unit test passes:** check `keymap.ts` —
  is the spec actually in `NORMAL_BINDINGS`/`INSERT_BINDINGS` and being
  stolen for the current mode (`bindingsForMode`)? Check the badge's `k=`
  field to see what spec RemNote actually reported for your keypress (it may
  not be what you expect — shift-blindness, punctuation remapping).
- **Commands compute against stale text/caret:** almost always a missing or
  wrong case in `VimAdapter.updateModel()` (§6) — either an action didn't
  update the model to match what it just did, or should have invalidated it
  and didn't.
- **Caret disappears / keyboard "dies" after a command:** you're missing a
  `walkCaretOut`-style escape before removing/reparenting the focused Rem's
  editor. `moveCaretVertical` only works while some text editor is focused;
  once that Rem is gone, the caret is unrecoverable — always move focus to a
  survivor *before* the structural change, not after. `stress.mjs`'s
  focus-alive invariant exists specifically to catch this.
- **`rx`/`done` in the badge diverge and stay diverged:** a key handler in
  `handleSym`/`exec` is stuck on an unresolved promise — check the newest
  `exec()` case you added for a missing `await` or an SDK call that can hang.
- **Rich text / register content looks wrong:** `registerToText` and
  `captureSubtree`/`pasteSubtree` (adapter.ts) are the serialize/deserialize
  pair for the line register — a Rem's `RichTextInterface` is an array of
  strings or `{text}` objects, not a plain string; don't assume `.text` is a
  flat string.

## 9. Platform constraints (read before fighting the SDK)

What's actually enforced in code you'll touch (all verified empirically
against RemNote 1.26.30):

- **Key stealing is SHIFT-BLIND.** The steal matcher reports the bare key
  regardless of Shift, and `shift+…` specs never match at all (probed live:
  with only `shift+v` stolen, neither `v` nor `V` is captured; with `v`
  stolen, both are captured and reported as `v`; `$` reports as `4`, `Q` as
  `q`). Ctrl combinations DO match correctly.
- **Leading whitespace**: RemNote's data layer trims it from a Rem
  immediately while the editor keeps it until a later normalization. The
  adapter mirrors the trim (`normalizeModel`) and extends column-0 deletes
  over the doomed whitespace — except `keepLead` (change-family) deletes,
  which stay vim-exact because an insert follows immediately.

- **Shift is unobservable** (`keymap.ts` top comment) → no real capital-key
  bindings, ever. Use the synonym pattern (§6).
- **The collapsed caret can't be read**, only moved relatively (§6) → don't
  add code that assumes you can query "where is the caret right now" from
  RemNote directly; track it in the model instead.
- **`requestNative: true` currently does nothing** (manifest.json has it set
  to `false`; `domCaret.ts` exists for if/when RemNote unblocks it, but
  `hostDocument()` will keep returning `null` in the sandbox until then).
- **Direct clipboard writes from the sandbox NEVER work** (probed live):
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText` rejects with "Document is not focused",
  the `clipboard-write` permission is hard-denied for the plugin iframe, and
  `execCommand('copy')` returns false (no user activation ever reaches the
  iframe — stolen keys arrive by async postMessage). Every clipboard write
  must ride a native editor operation in the host: text-range
  `selectText`+`cut()` (charwise) or `selectRem`+`copy()` (whole-rem).
- **`editor.cut()` on a Rem selection writes EMPTY html to the clipboard**
  (it serializes after removal). For rem cuts: `copy()` first, then remove
  via the SDK (`cutRems` in the adapter). Text-range `cut()` is unaffected.
- **`editor.selectRem` blurs the caret — recover it with a pane refocus.**
  The old "one-way door, never call it" rule is obsolete: capture
  `window.getFocusedPaneId()` before selecting, call
  `window.setFocusedPaneId(paneId)` after, and the Rem selection clears with
  the caret restored to its exact pre-selection rem AND column (verified
  with a marker insert). Nothing else recovers it: `collapseSelection`,
  `moveCaret`/`moveCaretVertical`, `selectText`, `selectRem([])`,
  `insertPlainText`, and even a real Escape (stolen by us) all leave the
  selection stuck — and while it's stuck, typed keys bypass the steal and
  open RemNote's selection-actions popup. Use `nativeClipboardRems` as the
  reference implementation; visual-line mode still uses the CSS-tint trail
  (a persistent native selection would keep the caret dead between keys).
- **RemNote can boot with `pointer-events-none` stuck on
  `.rn-editor-container`** (suppress-mouse-while-typing state that never
  clears when no real pointer enters the window — an e2e/CDP hazard more
  than a user-facing one). All CDP clicks then fall through to `<html>` and
  focus nothing. The e2e suites strip the class at startup; do the same in
  manual sessions if clicks mysteriously no-op.

## 10. Build & release

```bash
npm run check-types   # tsc --noEmit, run before committing
npm run build          # rm -rf dist && webpack (production) && zip dist/ → PluginZip.zip
```

`PluginZip.zip` is the distributable uploaded via RemNote's plugin store flow
(or side-loaded). `public/manifest.json` is copied into `dist/` verbatim by
`CopyPlugin` in `webpack.config.js` — bump `version` there for a release.
